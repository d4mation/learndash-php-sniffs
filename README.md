# stellarwp/learndash-php-sniffs

A set of PHP_CodeSniffer sniffs that I couldn't find anywhere else.

Install this by running `composer require --dev stellarwp/learndash-php-sniffs`.

I recommend also installing [dealerdirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer](https://github.com/DealerDirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer) as it will automatically make all included sniffs from this repository available under `learndash`.
